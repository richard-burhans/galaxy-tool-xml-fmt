"""GTX004: empty-element shorthand.

When a leaf element carries only whitespace as text (e.g. a tool author
wrote ``<inputs>\\n</inputs>`` rather than ``<inputs/>``), normalise it
to the short form by clearing ``element.text``. lxml then serialises
the element as ``<foo/>``.

Empty-string text (``element.text == ""``) is deliberately left alone:
it may be the surface form of an empty CDATA wrapper, and there is no
lxml-level way to distinguish an empty CDATA section from an empty
string. The conservative choice is to only touch text that is actually
whitespace.

Editorial; no IUC citation. PLAN.md prescribes ``<foo/>`` over
``<foo></foo>`` where the content model permits.
