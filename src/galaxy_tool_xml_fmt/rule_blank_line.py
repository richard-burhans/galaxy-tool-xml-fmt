"""GTX003: one blank line between top-level <tool> children.

Editorial rule from ``PLAN.md``: "one blank between sibling top-level
sections, no blank inside dense leaf sequences." Only the top-level
children of ``<tool>`` are affected; nested elements retain the
single-newline indentation supplied by GTX001.

Depends on GTX001 having set canonical indentation first (registration
order in ``format`` is the ordering). ``safe_set_tail`` will only write
when the existing tail is whitespace-only, so this rule cannot trample
non-whitespace content.
