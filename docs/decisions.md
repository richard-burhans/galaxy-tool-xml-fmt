# Decisions

This file records architectural decisions for `galaxy-tool-xml-fmt`,
mirroring the parent repository's `docs/decisions.md` conventions: each
entry cites a date and the rationale for the call.

## D1 (2026-05-27) — Rule framework architecture

### Decision

Internally, the formatter is organised as a registry of **rules**. Each
rule is a stateless `ABC` subclass; rules are registered at module-import
time via a `@register` decorator and listed by `all_rules()`. Each rule
implements `apply(tree) -> Iterable[Edit]`, where `Edit` is a
discriminated union of frozen dataclasses describing canonical-form
mutations. A single `apply_edits()` function dispatches the edits to
the lxml tree via `match/case` — the only place that mutates the tree
and the only place that needs to honour the CDATA whitespace-only guard.

### Versioning

Stability for CI consumers comes from **pinning** the formatter package
version in their lockfile (`galaxy-tool-xml-fmt==x.y.z`). The formatter
ships exactly one active rule set; there is no `--rules-version` CLI
flag and historical rules do not coexist in the source tree.

Per-rule provenance is recorded as `RuleMeta.since` and
`RuleMeta.until` — both documentary. `until` remains `None` while a
rule is active; it is stamped at retirement in the same commit that
deletes the rule class, purely for changelog purposes.

### Rationale

- **Pin-the-binary versioning** trades the ability to mix-and-match
  rule sets for a dramatically smaller test matrix and zero
  long-lived-historical-rule rot. The community pattern (`black`,
  `ruff`, `prettier`) is well understood by CI authors.
- **ABC over Protocol** for `Rule` reflects that rules are internal,
  enumerated, and tested — explicit inheritance is the right intent
  signal. (`dignified-python` prefers ABC for interface roles.)
- **`register()` stores the class**, not an instance. Rules are
  instantiated per format call. Avoids an import-time allocation and
  leaves a clean path for `__init__`-based config injection if a future
  rule needs it.
- **Instance methods on rules** match the wider Python ecosystem
  convention (pylint, flake8, LibCST, `ast.NodeVisitor`).
- **Edit-list pipeline** (rules return edits, a separate step applies
  them) is testable in isolation, enables a future `--diff` / `--check`
  cleanly, and concentrates the CDATA-safe lxml dance in exactly one
  place.

### Layout

Single package (`galaxy-tool-xml-fmt`) for now. A shared rule-engine
package will be extracted only when a second consumer materialises
(planned: `galaxy-tool-xml-migrate`).

### Reproducibility

Acceptance commands at the time of decision:

```sh
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy src
uv run pytest
```

## D2 (2026-05-27) — GTX002: `<param>` attribute ordering

### Decision

`<param>` elements have their attributes reordered to the canonical IUC
sequence:

```
name, argument, type, format,
min | truevalue, max | falsevalue, value | checked,
optional, label, help
```

Mutually-exclusive pairs (e.g. `min` vs `truevalue`) share a priority
slot. Any attribute not in the IUC list sorts alphabetically *after*
the known set.

### Source

- IUC Galaxy tool-XML style guide:
  https://galaxy-iuc-standards.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best_practices/tool_xml.html
- Reference implementation: `galaxyproject/galaxy-language-server`'s
  `IUCToolParamAttributeSorter`
  (`server/galaxyls/services/tools/iuc.py`).

### Mechanism

New `Edit` variant `ReorderAttributes(element, names)`. `apply_edits`
clears `element.attrib` and re-sets it in the given order. If `names`
is not a permutation of the current attribute set, the edit is a no-op
(defensive: a rule bug must never silently drop attributes).

The framework's first non-text-content `Edit` — exercises attribute-level
mutation in addition to the existing `SetText` / `SetTail`.

### Notes on related sources

- `galaxy-language-server` itself uses `lxml.etree.indent` directly for
  indentation, plus an IUC param attribute sorter separate from the
  formatter pipeline. We collapse these into one pipeline because
  pin-the-binary versioning makes a single pass sufficient.
- `planemo` has zero XML layout lint checks; it only validates against
  the Galaxy XSD and runs semantic checks (citations, conda, DOIs).

## D3 (2026-05-27) — Scope boundary: trivia vs. structure

### Decision

Tier 3 (this package) is responsible for **trivia only**: changes that
the XML 1.0 specification declares *non-significant*. Tier 2 (the
planned codemod) owns anything the XML spec declares *significant*.

Working classification:

| Concern | Spec-significant? | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| Whitespace between elements (indentation, blank lines) | no | **3** |
| Attribute order within an element | no (XML 1.0 §3.1) | **3** |
| Attribute quoting (single vs double) | no | **3** |
| Empty-element shorthand (`<foo/>` vs `<foo></foo>`) | no (lexical) | **3** |
| CDATA section vs escaped text | no (lexical) | **3** (edge) |
| Trailing whitespace inside whitespace-only text/tail | no | **3** |
| **Child element order** | **yes** | **2** |
| **Element name (rename, case-fix)** | **yes** | **2** |
| **Adding/removing elements** | **yes** | **2** |

### Source

This mirrors the parent repo's `docs/decisions.md`:

- §3: tier 3 owns trivia preservation; tier 1 ships no serializer.
- §9: tier 2 is "LibCST-shaped structural refactors"; tier 3 is the
  `black`-like formatter.

"LibCST-shaped" is the operative phrase — tier 2 changes what the
document *says*; tier 3 changes how it is *laid out*.

### Practical consequences

- IUC's "top-level element order" SHOULD-rule belongs to tier 2, not
  here. The formatter assumes its input is already in canonical
  element order and just lays it out nicely.
- IUC's "use CDATA for `<command>`/`<help>`" sits on the edge: by the
  principled line it's tier 3 (CDATA is lexical), but it has
  content-changing risk. Deferred until corpus data shows it firing.
- Cheetah quoting and Python/Cheetah PEP8 are out of scope entirely
  — they govern the contents of CDATA, which neither tier of the
  XML toolchain touches.

## D4 (2026-05-27) — GTX003: blank line between top-level `<tool>` children, and the `order` field on `RuleMeta`

### Decision

A new rule, **GTX003**, inserts one blank line between consecutive
top-level children of `<tool>`. Nested elements retain GTX001's
single-newline indentation. Editorial: PLAN.md says "one blank between
sibling top-level sections, no blank inside dense leaf sequences" and
no external source prescribes it more concretely (`cite=None`).

### Framework change forced by GTX003

GTX003 must run **after** GTX001 — it overwrites the tail values GTX001
sets. Until this rule, rule order was implicit (import-order, which
`ruff isort` alphabetises). GTX003 broke that: `rule_blank_line` sorts
before `rule_indent` alphabetically, so the blank-line tails were
overwritten by the subsequent indentation pass.

The fix: add `order: int = 100` to `RuleMeta`. `all_rules()` returns
rules sorted by this field (ties broken by registration order; Python's
sort is stable). Lower value runs first.

Current assignments:

| Rule | `order` |
|---|---|
| GTX001 (indentation) | 10 |
| GTX002 (param attr order) | 50 |
| GTX003 (blank line) | 90 |

Default of `100` keeps any future not-yet-classified rule at the end.
Multiples-of-ten leave room to insert between.

### Rationale

The alternative — making the pipeline care about import order, or
pinning the import order with `# noqa: I001` — would couple the rule
ordering to the layout of one file. Explicit `order` keeps each rule
self-describing.

### TDD record

Failing test (`test_blank_line_between_top_level_children`) was written
first; it failed in red on bare `format_tool_document` output, then
again after the rule module existed (registry-order bug, revealed by
the test); passed after the `order` field was added.

---

## D5 (2026-05-27) — GTX004: empty-element shorthand

### Decision

A new rule, **GTX004**, normalises leaf elements whose only content is
whitespace (e.g. `<inputs>\n</inputs>`) to the short form `<inputs/>`.

### Scope

The rule fires only when **all** of the following hold:
- the element has no children (`len(element) == 0`),
- `element.text` is not `None`,
- `element.text` is non-empty (i.e. not `""`),
- `element.text.strip() == ""` (whitespace-only).

Empty-string text (`element.text == ""`) is deliberately **not**
touched. lxml exposes empty CDATA as an empty string on `.text` with no
distinguishing API, so clearing it would silently drop the CDATA
wrapper. The whitespace-vs-empty distinction is the only safe
discriminator.

### Source

Editorial. `cite=None`. PLAN.md says "canonical: `<foo/>` over
`<foo></foo>` when the content model permits"; no external standard
prescribes this explicitly.

### Mechanism

New `Edit` variant `ClearText(element)`. `apply_edits` checks the same
whitespace-only guard `safe_set_text` uses, then assigns
`element.text = None`. Distinct from `SetText`: `SetText("")` leaves an
empty string that lxml serialises as long form, whereas `ClearText`
drops the text entirely and lxml's default `short_empty_elements=True`
emits `<foo/>`.

### Rule order

`order=20` — runs after GTX001 (indent, 10) and before GTX002 (param
attr, 50). Position doesn't actually matter for GTX004 since no other
rule touches leaf-element text, but the slot leaves room for future
text-mutating rules.

### TDD record

Six tests written first. Five passed against bare
`format_tool_document` (lxml's default `short_empty_elements=True`
already handles parsed-empty-as-short, real-text-preserved,
has-children-not-collapsed, CDATA-preserved, and idempotence-on-mixed
input). One failed: whitespace-only-text-collapses. The rule was added
to drive that case green; all six green after.

### Refinement (2026-05-28) — skip non-element nodes

The first corpus sweep (D9) found 12 non-idempotent fixtures, all of
which contained whitespace-only XML comments like `<!--  -->`. lxml's
`tree.iter()` yields `Comment` and `ProcessingInstruction` nodes
alongside elements; they have callable `.tag` (not strings),
`len() == 0`, and `.text` matching the comment body. The rule was
clearing those texts to `None`, which makes lxml drop the comment node
entirely from output — the next format pass then produced different
bytes, and the comment was permanently lost.

GTX004 now skips any node whose `.tag` is not a `str`. The behaviour
is covered by `test_whitespace_only_xml_comment_is_preserved` in
`tests/test_rule_empty_element.py` and by the 12 fixtures replayed
under `tests/test_regressions.py`. Post-fix, the 2026-05-28 sweep
reports 4,014 / 4,014 idempotent (D9).

## D6 (2026-05-28) — GTX005: `<tool>` attribute ordering, and the shared `attribute_ordering` helper

### Decision

A new rule, **GTX005**, enforces canonical attribute order on the root
`<tool>` element. Order: `id`, `name`, `version`, `profile`, then
alphabetical for the rest.

### Refactor: shared `attribute_ordering` module

GTX005 has the same shape as GTX002 (priority map + sort within an
element's `attrib`). Rather than duplicate the implementation, the
shared logic moved to
`src/galaxy_tool_xml_fmt/attribute_ordering.py`:

- `canonical_order(names, priority)` — sort names by the priority map,
  falling back to alphabetical for unknowns.
- `reorder_attribute_edits(elements, priority)` — yield
  `ReorderAttributes` edits for any element whose current attribute
  order differs from the canonical.

Each per-element-kind rule (GTX002 for `<param>`, GTX005 for `<tool>`)
defines its own priority table and calls the helper. Future
element-kind orderings plug in the same way.

### Source

The Galaxy 26.1 XSD declares these `<tool>` attributes (required first):
`id`, `name`, `version`, `hidden`, `display_interface`, `tool_type`,
`profile`, `license`, `python_template_version`, `workflow_compatible`,
`URL_method`, `require_login`. The XSD imposes no display order; the
canonical order is convention from the Galaxy schema documentation page,
which consistently shows `id`, `name`, `version`, `profile` as the lead
attributes in its examples.

Cite: `https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/dev/schema.html`. Weaker
authority than IUC, but it's the only documented source.

### Rule order

`order=55` — runs just after GTX002 (`order=50`). The two are
independent (different element kinds), so the choice is arbitrary; the
explicit slot leaves room to insert between if a future rule's ordering
matters.

### TDD record

Five tests written first. Two passed trivially before the rule existed
(idempotent input had `id` first already; non-tool root is left alone
because no rule touches it). Three failed: reorder-to-canonical,
profile-after-required, and unknown-attributes-alphabetical. All five
passed after the refactor + new rule shipped.

## D7 (2026-05-28) — Attribute quoting: always double quotes (policy without a rule)

### Decision

All attribute values in formatter output are double-quoted; any
embedded ``"`` is escaped as ``&quot;``. Single-quoted attributes do
not appear in the output regardless of input.

### Mechanism: no rule needed

This policy is **already enforced by lxml's ``etree.tostring`` default**
— verified 2026-05-28:

| Input attribute value | Serialised output |
|---|---|
| `simple` | `a="simple"` |
| `has "quote"` | `a="has &quot;quote&quot;"` |
| `it's fine` | `a="it's fine"` |
| `has both " and '` | `a="has both &quot; and '"` |

So there is no GTX rule for this. The policy is locked in by
``tests/test_attribute_quoting.py``, which acts as regression
coverage against any future lxml change.

### Source

- IUC tool-XML style guide: SHOULD (implicit in all examples).
- Galaxy schema docs: convention (all examples use double quotes).
- lxml ≥ 5: default behaviour matches the policy.

### Rationale for not adding a rule

A rule that emits no edits when its policy is already satisfied is
noise in the registry. The same outcome is reached by:

1. Documenting the policy here (D7).
2. Letting the serializer's default do the work.
3. Locking the behaviour in with tests.

If a future lxml release changed the default, the tests would fail and
we would write a real rule then. Today, no rule.

### TDD record

Four "characterization" tests written; all four passed on arrival.
Not strict red→green TDD (the behaviour was already correct); the
value here is regression coverage, not implementation drive.

---

## D8 (2026-05-28) — Attributes on one line (policy without a rule)

### Decision

Every element's attributes appear on a single line in formatter output,
regardless of how they were laid out in the source. The IUC SHOULD
allows `label` / `help` to wrap onto their own line "for large XML
elements"; our canonical form is stricter — **no exception, always one
line.**

### Mechanism: no rule needed

This is **already enforced by lxml's ``etree.tostring`` default** —
verified 2026-05-28:

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| `<param\n    name="x"\n    type="text"/>` (attributes across lines) | `<param name="x" type="text"/>` |
| `<param>` with many attributes | all on one line |
| `attr` whose value contains `\n` | `attr="line1&#10;line2"` (newline becomes an entity, attribute stays on one line) |
| `attr` value with literal tab | `attr="...&#9;..."` (tab becomes `&#9;`) |

So no GTX rule is needed. The policy is locked in by
``tests/test_attribute_line_layout.py``, which includes a strong
no-newline-inside-any-start-tag assertion as a backstop against any
future serializer drift.

### Rationale for the stricter-than-IUC choice

A `black`-style formatter has one canonical output per input. IUC's
"label/help may wrap for large elements" requires a threshold ("how
large is large?") and produces two valid forms for the same content.
Picking one form (always inline) preserves canonicalisation and matches
what lxml does anyway.

### TDD record

Four "characterization" tests written; all four passed on arrival
against bare `format_tool_document`. Same shape as D7: no
implementation needed, value is regression coverage.

---

## D9 (2026-05-28) — Corpus runner, fixture retention, and the first idempotence sweep

### Decision

`scripts/corpus_check.py` is the maintainer-facing tool that gates the
formatter's two invariants against the public Galaxy tool corpus:
**no crashes**, and **`format(format(x)) == format(x)`** byte-for-byte.
It mirrors the design of `galaxy-tool-xml/scripts/corpus_check.py` so
the two scripts answer different questions on the same corpus with
familial ergonomics (`--repo`, `--limit`, `--no-stats`).

### Scope

The first sweep is restricted to tools that validate under the
**latest vendored profile** (26.1 as of 2026-05-28). Validity is
established by tier 1's `validate_tool`; non-validating tools are
skipped, not failed. Future sweeps may relax the gate, but starting
with the latest-profile cohort keeps the failure surface bounded to
the tools the formatter is intended for first.

### Mechanism

For each XML file in the cloned corpus:

1. `parse_tool(path)` (skip if recover fails or root tag ≠ `tool`).
2. `validate_tool(path, profile="26.1")` (skip if not valid).
3. Format pass 1 with per-rule edit counts collected.
4. Re-parse the pass-1 bytes; format pass 2 with per-rule edit counts.
5. If `pass1_bytes != pass2_bytes`, retain the tool plus any imported
   `<import>`-referenced macros under `tests/data/regressions/`.

The retention key is the tuple `(source_repo, repo_relative_path)`,
recorded in `tests/data/regressions/PROVENANCE.md`. A second run never
re-retains a tool that's already in PROVENANCE; a new failing tool
adds a row. This differs from the parent's signature-keyed dedup
because the formatter's failure modes are diverse enough that
"signature" undercounts the fixture diversity we want.

### Stats

`docs/corpus_format_stats.md` is regenerated by every full sweep and
shows per-repo counts, the sweep outcome table, per-rule trigger
totals for pass 1 and pass 2, and the failure-signature breakdown.
Partial sweeps (`--limit`, `--repo`) do not regenerate it.

### First sweep result (2026-05-28)

| Cohort | Count |
|---|---:|
| Documents parsed as `<tool>` | 4,190 |
| Validated under profile 26.1 | 4,014 |
| Idempotent | **4,014 (100%)** |
| Non-idempotent | 0 |
| Crashed | 0 |

The initial run before the GTX004 comment-skip refinement (D5) found
12 non-idempotent tools, all variants of the same bug: whitespace-only
XML comments were being clobbered by GTX004. Those 12 fixtures are
retained as permanent regression coverage (`tests/test_regressions.py`)
even though they now pass — they encode the bug class so we don't
regress it.

### Reproducibility

Sweep commit pinned per-repo via `git rev-parse HEAD` and surfaced in
`docs/corpus_format_stats.md`. Re-running on a different corpus
snapshot will diff the per-repo `Version` column.

```sh
uv run python scripts/corpus_check.py
```

### Rationale

- **Gate on validation, not parsing.** A formatter that runs over
  tools that don't validate amplifies noise; the latest-profile cohort
  is the slice we're actually shipping for. Future relaxations are
  cheap (drop the `--profile` flag's default).
- **Retain all failing tools, not one per signature.** Tier-3 bugs
  are about laying out content; the same bug class can have multiple
  surface forms (different containers, different surrounding
  whitespace), and replaying every one in `pytest` is cheap.
- **Per-rule edit stats are surface-only.** A `SetText` whose target
  value equals the existing one is still a "trigger" by edit count,
  even though the tree is unchanged. The byte comparison is the
  authoritative did-it-change signal; the per-rule counts answer
  "which rule was even invoked".
